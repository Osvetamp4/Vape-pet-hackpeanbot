# Vape-pet-hackpeanbot
 
Vape-Pet is a web application submission for the HackBeanPot Hackathon 2025.



The core idea of Vape-Pet is a Harm-Reduction Software that doesn't seek to completely cure the user of their vape or smoking addiction but rather provide a plan of action to slowly reduce the user's vape/smoking usage.

Vape-Pet provides the user with the ability to document and follow their usage, and henceforth allow for self-accountability.
